This repository contains an implementation for design patterens detection. In this task, feature engineering and ensemble learning are applied. The dataset is a subset of source code metrics for each an every java project. Each project in the dataset belongs to one of 3 categories. The categories are described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns/). Dataset for the task can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mcmeqfxt6crrgpn/Dp_data_modified.zip?dl=0/).
